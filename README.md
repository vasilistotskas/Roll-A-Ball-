# Roll-A-Ball-
classic roll a ball game from unity but with some more (+second floor)

I had a senior seminar project to do , so i used a game tutorial to make a roll a ball game and i add some new stuff with wall colision , score count , win board 
and a secod floor to this mini game . Thats the first game i built .

To open this game you need Unity engine , download the files and Assets > _Completed_Game > Roll-a-ball file
